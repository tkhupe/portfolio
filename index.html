          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>Hello everyone, I am a young man born in Zimbabwe,
            who moved to Texas in 2002 to go
            to college. I initially came to the country with a desire to study Medicine
            and understand how people are affected by HIV and perhaps work in a
            research field where i would hopefully be in the fight
            for a cure. I have worked in a various array of disciplines in order
            to gain a more enriched life experience,
            changing form manual labor industries to e-commerce.
            I enjoy building things and solving problems as part of my every day life.
            I also spent time in my garden growing flowers and
            frequently walking my dogs. I currently live in Austin Texas, however
            I would be happy to relocate because I enjoy having new
            experiences.
